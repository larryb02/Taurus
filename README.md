# go rewrite
The purpose of this branch is to rewrite the ssh-client with golang. The purpose of this is to directly implement the ssh client on top of the ssh protocol and replace the current implementation that is built on top of node-pty. This will allow for a smoother development process and will allow me to develop more features and provide a secure experience to users.

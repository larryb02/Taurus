# web-ssh

- MVP for a modern, easy to access, easy to use ssh client. Currently a terminal that is accessible via the web.
- Migrating to a desktop approach via electron because I want the pty instance to be ran locally, with the web based approach this doesn't appear to be possible without forcing the user to download some sort of program, and at that point I may as well create a desktop app. I'm hoping that as I develop I'll find a way to add support for a web application as well.
